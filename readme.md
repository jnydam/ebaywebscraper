**John Nydam's Ebay Web Scraper Project**

This project is a simple test automation framework for 
the Ebay Home Page.

Due to the fact that it mostly retrieves and prints out data from the site, it acts
as a web scraper. 

This project was created using Java, Selenium, Maven, and TestNG. 

It uses best Objected Oriented Programming practices and the page-object model. (Each
web page is its own java class).

Furthermore, inheritance is used for further integration between the base class and various test
cases. 

**Installation and Setup**

This project requires that you have both Java and Maven installed.
At the time of project creation, this project was using Java 11, and
Apache Maven 3.8.1

Once these are installed, download or clone the project.

Then navigate into the working directory on the terminal (/ebaywebscraper/)
and run ```mvn test```

Since the chrome driver application is already in the repository, everything should be set, and
you can view the tests run! Enjoy!
